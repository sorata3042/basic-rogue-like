# basic-rogue-like

A rogue like created as a final project in an Object Oriented Design course. The project is based off of a Princeton programming assignment: https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/assignments/rogue.html. I have implemented a GUI using JavaFx.

The game involves a 2-D grid called a dungeon and two players that alternate moving: a rogue and a monster. 
Rogue's goal is to reach the exit while evading the monster. The user pilots the Rogue while an algorithm directs the monster.
